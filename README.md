# Custom GPT Chatbot for a Physical Therapist

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with OpenAI's APIs while building a practical, custom chatbot for a Physical Therapist. My brother-in-law, a Doctor of Physical Therapy, needed a tool to quickly access answers to common questions during his work. To address this need, I developed this custom GPT chatbot.

## Technologies Used
